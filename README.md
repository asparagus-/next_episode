<b>next_episode</b>
============
a simple little script that you can drop into a directory filled with video files <br>

<ol><b>the objective:</b>
  <li>play the next video file in lexicographical order</li>
  <li>save the file after next that to be played later</li>
</ol>

<ul><b>use case:</b>
  <li>"which episode am i on? was it 6 or 7? maybe it was 8?"</li>
  <li>"oh yeah i can just run this script" *double clicks script*</li>
  <li>*video player opens and starts playing episode 9*</li>
  <li>"wow! now i dont have to open a bunch of files to realize which episode im on!"</li>
</ul>
  
<b>note: </b> since the file's "default program" will be used to open the file, this script, in theory, can be used to open any file in lexicographical order, rather than just video or music files.
